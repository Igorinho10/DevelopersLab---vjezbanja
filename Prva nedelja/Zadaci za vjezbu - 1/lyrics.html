        <i>
            I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
            To take a stand (to take a stand)
            Everybody (everybody)
            Come take my hand (come take my hand)
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just letting you know that you're not alone
            Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
                
            Yeah, it's been a ride
            I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
            Now some of you, might still be in that place
            If you're trying to get out, just follow me
            I'll get you there
                
            You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
            But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
            'Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
            When I say I'mma do something I do it
            I don't give a damn what you think
            I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
            Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
            I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
            And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
            No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
            From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
            He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
            Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
            Whichever comes first, for better or worse
            He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
            His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
            To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe
                
            I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
            To take a stand (to take a stand)
            Everybody (everybody)
            Come take my hand (come take my hand)
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just letting you know that you're not alone
            Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
                
            Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
            I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
            You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
            For that fuck your feelings
            Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
            And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
            I promise to never go back on that promise
            In fact let's be honest
            That last "Relapse" CD was "ehh"
            Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
            Relax, I ain't going back to that now
            All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
            'Cause I ain't playing around
            There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
            But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
            Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
            Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
            These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
                
            I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
            To take a stand (to take a stand)
            Everybody (everybody)
            Come take my hand (come take my hand)
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just letting you know that you're not alone
            Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
                
            And I just can't keep living this way
            So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
            I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
            I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
            I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
            Time to put my life back together right now! (now)
                
            It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
            Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
            For you, so I could come back a brand-new me you helped see me through
            And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
            I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
            I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
            My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
            And drop dead, no more beef lingers
            No more drama from now on, I wanna promise
            To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
            So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
            And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
            'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
            Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
            'Cause I'm raising the bar
            I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
            I feel amazing and I'm...
                
            I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
            To take a stand (to take a stand)
            Everybody (everybody)
            Come take my hand (come take my hand)
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just letting you know that you're not alone
            Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

            [Verse 1]
            It's in your eyes, a colour fade-out
            Looks like a new transition
            Is starting up and shaking your ground
            Turning your head to see a new day calling
            Does it feel like a head to lean on
            A snapshot from where you were born?
            I'm looking for your hand in the rough
            You're caught in the wire
            Well, I'll lift you out

            [Verse 2]
            Leaning on the action
            Caught in a cellphone's rays
            Bleeding on the sofa
            Staring at the wayside
            He's coming and she knows it
            Even if she knows why
            Footsteps in the hallway
            Girl, you haven't got time

            [Pre-Chorus]
            You gotta get out
            Go far away
